# Luna lander


This project was made for practicing games for web. 

It is a sigle player game inspired by the old Atari game Lunar Land.

The player has to land as more precisely as he/she can to take a great picture of the Earth (from the moon). Using the arrows on the kyboard the player controls the spaceship and has to land in the "center" of the Earth before fuel is over
